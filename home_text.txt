Welcome

Reading is one of life's simple pleasures. Please search the database by using the tools in the side bar. Hopefully you will find something that appeals.

I must confess to having a love of Science Fiction so many of the books that I have reviewed are from that genre. The plan is to add more reviews to this site as time allows.

If you'd like to suggest a book for review, please feel free to get in touch.
